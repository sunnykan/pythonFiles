Python scripts and notebook files

**ml-uwash/course-2**: folder contains python notebooks for exercises from course 2 (Multiple Regression) of the 
University of Washington's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

**misc/wine**: folder contains analysis of wine quality data from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) machine learning repository. An analysis in R of the same data can be found [here](https://github.com/sunnykan/RFiles/blob/master/wine/wines.md).

**misc/bikeshare**: code for wrangling bikeshare data for vancouver, montreal and toronto. the collected data is cleaned and inserted into a postgres database. also includes code for downloading canadian weather data which is then inserted into the postgres database. there are three tables in the database: list of bike stations, bicycle trips for all three cities and weather data for the periods when the trips were taken. the tables are linked.
- important lesson: always have a plan for cleaning data and do it systematically.
